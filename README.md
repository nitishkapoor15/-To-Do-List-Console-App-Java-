# To-Do List Console App – Java
This is a simple **console-based To-Do List application** built using **Java** as part of my **15-Day Java Project Challenge**.

On **Day 2**, I focused on building an interactive CLI app where users can:

- ➕ Add a new task  
- 📋 View all tasks  
- ❌ Delete a task  
- ✔️ Mark a task as completed

## 🔧 Features
- Object-Oriented Design using `Task` and `ToDoList` classes
- Input handling using `Scanner`
- Error prevention using `try-catch` blocks
- User-friendly menu and console messages

---
## Project Structure**
ToDoListApp ├── Main.java # Main class with user menu ├── Task.java # Represents a single task └── ToDoList.java # Manages list of tasks

##  What I Learned
- How to structure a project with multiple classes in Java
- Exception handling with `InputMismatchException`
- Managing dynamic lists using `ArrayList`
- Writing cleaner and modular code using methods

## 🚀 Run the App

Make sure you have **Java installed**, then compile and run the project:
